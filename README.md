# About OpenFLUID

OpenFLUID is a software environment for spatial modelling in landscapes. Based on an explicit representation of spatial objects and their interactions, OpenFLUID is designed for modelling dynamics at different spatial and temporal scales. It provides functionalities for the development and integration of computational codes, model coupling, parameterization and execution of simulations. It is also a collaborative framework for the capitalization and sharing of multi-disciplinary scientific models.  
OpenFLUID has already been applied in various contexts: hydrology, diffuse pollution, agricultural practices, erosion, land use planning, etc.
Free, open-source and based on open standards, OpenFLUID is fully commited to open and reproducible science approaches.

## Built with

OpenFLUID relies on several tools and libraries

* C++17
* [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) for low-level structures
* [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) for geospatial data I/O and management
* [JSON](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) for metadata and settings I/O
* [TinyXML](https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2) for datasets I/O
* [libcurl](https://github.com/curl/curl) for network operations
* [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/) for UI framework and applications, Qt6 potentially incoming
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for build/test/packaging configuration and management
* [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) for technical documentation


# Getting started

## Installation

OpenFLUID is available for Linux, MacOS and Windows. You can download it from the [official web site](https://www.openfluid-project.org/).

Once the installation has been performed using instructions below according to the operating system, open a terminal (Linux, MacOS) or a command prompt (Windows) an type `openfluid version` to check if the installation is successful.  
The OpenFLUID version is displayed if it is correctly installed.

</div>

### Linux

1. Download the package corresponding to the Linux distribution
1. Open a terminal
1. Use the dedicated package installer tool

Ubuntu/Debian
```sh
sudo apt install /path/to/<openfluidpackagfile>.deb
```

Fedora
```sh
sudo dnf install /path/to/<openfluidpackagfile>.rpm
```

### MacOS

1. Install Brew if not already present (see also https://brew.sh/)
```sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

2. Add OpenFLUID tap for Brew
```sh
brew tap OpenFLUID/openfluid
```

3. Install OpenFLUID using Brew (with --no-quarantine option to avoid Gatekeeper restrictions in recent MacOS versions)
```sh
brew cask install --no-quarantine openfluid
```

### Windows

1. Download the OpenFLUID installer
1. Download the OpenFLUID additional tools installer
1. Execute the OpenFLUID installer (optional but recommended)
1. Execute the OpenFLUID additional tools installer (optional but recommended)

Additional information is available on the [OpenFLUID Community site](https://community.openfluid-project.org/start/install/#windows)
