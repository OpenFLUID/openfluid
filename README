OpenFLUID sources
=================

The OpenFLUID source tree is organized as follow
- cmake : CMake files included in main build system 
- doc: Doxygen and LaTeX sources for users and developers manuals
- po : i18n files
- examples : examples of projects and simulator
- resources : general resources for building, testing and packaging
- share : shared resources at runtime
- src/apps/ : sources of the OpenFLUID applications
- src/openfluid : sources of the OpenFLUID framework


OpenFLUID relies on open-source libraries, required for build or use OpenFLUID.
The required libraries are:
for the OpenFLUID framework libraries: 
  - C++ STL
  - Boost (system, filesystem)
  - Qt : Core, XML, Network, GUI (optional)
  - GDAL/OGR
  - GEOS (optional)
for openfluid command line application: 
  - OpenFLUID framework libraries
  - C++ STL
  - Boost (system, filesystem, program_options, date_time, regex)  
for openfluid-builder GUI application: 
  - OpenFLUID framework libraries
  - C++ STL
  - Boost
  - Qt : GUI


For unit testing, the Boost unit testing framework is also required (unit_test_framework)


For building Latex documents, required tools and packages are:
- pdflatex
- latex2html
- packages: a4wide, babel, ltxtable, pgf/tikz, tabularx, verbatim
- fonts: cmbright
