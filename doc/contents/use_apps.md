# OpenFLUID software environment {#use_apps}

[TOC]

OpenFLUID simulations can be run either using the command line interface (`openfluid` program),
the graphical user interface (`openfluid-builder` program),
or through bindings with external languages and environments such as R using the ROpenFLUID package.  
All these programs and packages use the same input dataset format (See @ref use_fluidx),
and propose all concepts and features of the OpenFLUID software environment,
as they share the unique OpenFLUID software framework. 


## Graphical Interface for simulations : OpenFLUID-Builder {#use_apps_builder}

The OpenFLUID-Builder user interface proposes a graphical environment to
prepare, parameterize and execute simulations. It is a good starting point for users 
who want to discover the OpenFLUID concepts and software environment.
It can be run either from the desktop menu of your system
or from a console by typing the `openfluid-builder` command.

OpenFLUID-Builder functionalities can be extended by Builder-extensions 
which are graphical plugins for this user interface. 
By default, OpenFLUID is provided with two Builder-extensions:
a graph viewer representing the spatial domain as a connected graph, 
and a spatial data importer to create a spatial domain from standard GIS data file formats
(such as Shapefiles) or from a WFS service (Web Feature Service) 
available from a local or an internet server.  


## Command-line interface : openfluid {#use_apps_cmd}

The OpenFLUID command line interface allows to run OpenFLUID simulations from a terminal, 
using the `openfluid` program. 
This usage is particularly useful for running multiple simulations in batch
or on compute systems such as compute clusters.  
To run the simulation, execute the `openfluid` program with adapted commands and options.
You can run a simulation using the `run` command and giving the input dataset path or the project path 
and the optional results output path:
```sh
openfluid run (</path/to/dataset>|</path/to/project>) [</path/to/results>]
```

When running a project, the results output path is ignored as it is already defined by the project itself.
The project must be a valid OpenFLUID project (see @ref apdx_prj), usually created using the OpenFLUID-Builder user interface.
It can also be created manually. 

See @ref apdx_optenv_cmdopt or run `openfluid --help` to get the list of available commands and options.

# Development environment : OpenFLUID-DevStudio {#use_apps_devstudio}

The OpenFLUID-Devstudio is the part of the software environment dedicated to development of simulators, observers 
and builder-extensions. It proposes functionnalities for assisted source code creation and development.
It can be run either from the desktop menu of your system
or from a console by typing the `openfluid-devstudio` command.  

<br/>

The OpenFLUID-DevStudio environment proposes the following facilities:

* Assisted creation of simulators, observers and builder-extensions
* Ware-centered organization of workspace with navigator
* Integrated configuration and build of source code (for debug and install modes)
* OpenFLUID-oriented completion system (as you type and through contextual menu)
* Direct access to online documentation
* Common features of a source code editor   

More informations about OpenFLUID-Devstudio are available in the @ref dev_createsim part.


# Within the GNU R environment : ROpenFLUID {#use_apps_R}

OpenFLUID can be used from within the GNU R environment through the ROpenFLUID package.
This package allows to load an input dataset, parameterize and run a simulation, 
then use and process simulation results.  
It is really useful for taking benefit of all R features and packages for sensitivity analysis, 
optimization, uncertainty propagation analysis, and more.

_Example of a simulation launch in R using the ROpenFLUID package:_
```
library('ROpenFLUID')
ofsim = OpenFLUID.loadDataset('/path/to/dataset')
OpenFLUID.setCurrentOutputDir('/path/to/results')
OpenFLUID.runSimulation(ofsim)
data = OpenFLUID.loadResult(ofsim,'TestUnits',15,'var.name')
```

More details are available in the dedicated ROpenFLUID documentation, available on the OpenFLUID community site (<https://community.openfluid-project.org/>).
