\page dev_oviewsim Overview of an OpenFLUID simulator

Technically speaking, an OpenFLUID simulator is made of two main parts: 
The signature and a C++ class containing the computational code.


\section dev_oviewsim_signature Simulator signature 

The signature of a simulator contains meta-informations about the simulator.
These informations will be mainly used for automatic coupling 
and consistency checking of simulators.
To get more informations about the simulators signatures, see part \ref dev_signature.
  

\section dev_oviewsim_cppclass Simulator C++ class

The computational part of a simulator is defined by a class, 
inherited from the \if DocIsLaTeX \b \endif openfluid::ware::PluggableSimulator class.
The simulation code have to be written into the different methods
provided by the \if DocIsLaTeX \b \endif openfluid::ware::PluggableSimulator class.
You can also develop other methods in order to structure your source code.\n
To get more information about the C++ class of a simulator, see part \ref dev_createsim.


\subsection dev_oviewsim_cppclass_cstrdstr Constructor and destructor

The constructor of the simulator is called when the simulator is loaded.
You may put here the initialization of your private members.\n
The destructor of the simulator is called when the simulator is released after simulation,
at the end of the execution of the OpenFLUID application.
You may put here instruction to free the memory you allocated 
for the needs of the computational code (other objects, pointed vars, ...).


\subsection dev_oviewsim_cppclass_methods Mandatory methods to be defined

The class defining a simulator must define the following methods:
<ul>
<li>\if DocIsLaTeX \b initParams \else \link openfluid::ware::PluggableSimulator::initParams initParams \endlink \endif
<li>\if DocIsLaTeX \b prepareData \else \link openfluid::ware::PluggableSimulator::prepareData prepareData \endlink \endif
<li>\if DocIsLaTeX \b checkConsistency \else \link openfluid::ware::PluggableSimulator::checkConsistency checkConsistency \endlink \endif
<li>\if DocIsLaTeX \b initializeRun \else \link openfluid::ware::PluggableSimulator::initializeRun initializeRun \endlink \endif
<li>\if DocIsLaTeX \b runStep \else \link openfluid::ware::PluggableSimulator::runStep runStep \endlink \endif
<li>\if DocIsLaTeX \b finalizeRun \else \link openfluid::ware::PluggableSimulator::finalizeRun finalizeRun \endlink \endif

</ul>

\n
The \if DocIsLaTeX \b initParams \else \link openfluid::ware::PluggableSimulator::initParams initParams \endlink \endif 
 method should be used to retreive the parameters of the simulator, 
read from the model.fluidx file or filled from the OpenFLUID-Builder interface (See \ref user_fluidx_sections_model). 
Once read, the values should be stored into private attributes to be accessed by other methods.  

The \if DocIsLaTeX \b prepareData \else \link openfluid::ware::PluggableSimulator::prepareData prepareData \endlink \endif
 method should be used to do data pre-processing before the consistency checking.

The \if DocIsLaTeX \b checkConsistency \else \link openfluid::ware::PluggableSimulator::checkConsistency checkConsistency \endlink \endif
 method is called during the global consistency checking phase.
It should be used to add specific consistency checking for the simulator. 

The \if DocIsLaTeX \b initializeRun \else \link openfluid::ware::PluggableSimulator::initializeRun initializeRun \endlink \endif
 method must be used for initialization of simulation variables, 
or to compute initialization data.

The \if DocIsLaTeX \b runStep \else \link openfluid::ware::PluggableSimulator::runStep runStep \endlink \endif
 method is called at each exchange time step. It should contain the computational code.

The \if DocIsLaTeX \b finalizeRun \else \link openfluid::ware::PluggableSimulator::finalizeRun finalizeRun \endlink \endif
 method should be used to do post-processing after simulation. It is the last method ran.
