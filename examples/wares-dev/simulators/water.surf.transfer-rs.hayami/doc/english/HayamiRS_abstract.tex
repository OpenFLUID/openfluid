The ``\englishname'' compute the water transfer through the ditch network 
using the diffusive wave model resolved by the Hayami method. First, it 
calculates the input volume in reach segments. Then, the input hydrogram is 
convoluted using diffusive wave model with celerity and diffusivity as main 
parameters. Finally, the simulator converts the calculated output discharge 
to water height in the ditch using Manning-Strickler equation.
