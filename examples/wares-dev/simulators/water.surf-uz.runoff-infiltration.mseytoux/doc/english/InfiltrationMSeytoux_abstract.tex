The rain is separated by the ``\englishname'' into infiltration and runoff on each SU. The function computes the time before all the rain is infiltrated. This caracteristic time is called ``ponding time'' $t_p$. When the ponding time is reached, the function calculates the soil infiltrability using the hydraulic conductivity and the initial soil water content and deduces the runoff. This model is adapted to the \textbf{simulation at the event scale}.
