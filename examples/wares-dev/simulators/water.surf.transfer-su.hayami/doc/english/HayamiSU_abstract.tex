The simulator ``\englishname'' produces water discharge at the outlet of SU 
from runoff. Firstly, the simulator calculates the water height to 
propagate, which is the sum of the water runoff generated by a production 
function and the exfiltration volume if it exists. Then, the simulator 
computes the water discharge between connected units using diffusive wave 
model resolved with the Hayami method. The main parameters of this model are 
wave celerity and diffusivity.
